KLOC-1#1 Error
Incorrect Loc for kria boards  
The following port(s) RD_SEL_1[4] are placed on the VRP PACKAGE_PIN W9 in IOBANK 65 respectively.  In Kria K26 System-On-Module, this VRP PACKAGE_PIN is tied to a grounded 240-ohm external reference resistor to support Digitally Controlled Impedance (DCI).  No PORTs can be placed on the Kria K26 VRP PACKAGE_PINs AD6, W9 and G4.  Please check your design
Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
114 out of 114 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: ADDR[4:0], CLK, D_IN[31:0], D_OUT_1[31:0], D_OUT_2[31:0], EN,
RD_SEL_1[4:0], RD_SEL_2[4:0], WR_EN.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
114 out of 114 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: ADDR[4:0], CLK, D_IN[31:0], D_OUT_1[31:0], D_OUT_2[31:0], EN,
RD_SEL_1[4:0], RD_SEL_2[4:0], WR_EN.
